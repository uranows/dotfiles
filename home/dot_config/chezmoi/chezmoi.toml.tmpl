# --- Windows Specific Mappings ---
{{ if eq .chezmoi.os "windows" -}}

# Map PowerShell Profile from apps/ directory
# Target path is relative to the user's home directory
["Documents/PowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1"]
    source = "apps/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1"
    type = "file" # Can be file or template

# Windows Terminal mapping removed - handled by run_once script

{{ end -}}

# --- Interpreters ---
# Explicitly tell chezmoi how to run scripts on different platforms
[interpreters]
  # Match standard .ps1 files on Windows
  [interpreters.ps1]
    command = "powershell.exe"
    args = ["-NoProfile", "-NoLogo", "-ExecutionPolicy", "Bypass", "-File"]

  # Run .sh scripts via WSL bash.exe on Windows (requires WSL)
  [interpreters.sh]
    command = "bash.exe"
    args = ["-eu", "-o", "pipefail"]

# --- Scripts ---
# Note: We're now using the .chezmoiscripts directory approach
# This is the recommended way to handle cross-platform scripts
# Scripts in .chezmoiscripts/ are automatically:
# 1. Made executable (regardless of file attribute)
# 2. Run in alphanumeric order
# 3. Only run when appropriate (run_once, run_onchange)
# 4. Not added to target state directory

# --- General chezmoi settings can go here ---
# Example: Use VS Code for editing
# [edit]
#   command = "code"
#   args = ["--wait"]

# Add other settings as needed (e.g., encryption, git config)
